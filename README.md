# React Exercise App

A simple React-based exercise tracker that allows users to select different exercises, tracking repetition or duration exercises. The app demo provides an interactive interface with two exercise types:  

- **Repetition Exercise**: Users can increase and reset a counter.  
- **Duration Exercise**: A timer starts when the user clicks the button, and it displays the time in **MM:SS:MS (minutes, seconds, milliseconds)** format.  

## Features  
- Select an exercise from the menu.  
- Track repetitions for repetition-based exercises.  
- Start and reset a timer for duration-based exercises.  
- Smooth UI with centered design and clean buttons.
